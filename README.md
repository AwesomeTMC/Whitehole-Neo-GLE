# Whitehole Neo GLE
This repository contains a bunch of helpful stuff for using Whitehole Neo with GLE.
## Setup
Put these files in your Whitehole Neo `data` folder. It should ask if you want to overwrite, click yes.

## shortcuts.json 
BCSVs that GLE only uses will appear in the BCSV editor.

Some BCSVs that are no longer used in GLE will not appear.

Note: The `shortcuts.json` file will only apply these changes when `ScenarioData/FileSelect.reg` exists in your selected mod's directory.
## hashlookup.txt
Hashes that appear in GLE only are added.
Credits to BlueXD for the couple of new GLE-V3 hashes.
